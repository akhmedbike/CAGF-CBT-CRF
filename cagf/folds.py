"""Cross-validation fold construction for UD_Kazakh-KTB.

Two strategies:

* ``stratified`` -- sentences are grouped by source document
  (``source_of(sent_id)``), and the *blocks* assigned to folds are built so that
  each fold's source distribution tracks the corpus distribution as closely as
  a single pass of greedy block allocation allows. Sentences are then
  shuffled across folds by block, so individual sentences of the same source
  can land in different folds. This mirrors a random stratified split.

* ``grouped`` -- every sentence of a given source goes into exactly one fold,
  so no source document is ever split across folds. This is the
  leakage-by-duplication control requested by the reviewer protocol: UDHR and
  the wikitravel phrasebook are templated, so a random split lets near-duplicate
  sentences leak from train into test. Grouped CV removes that.

Fold layout (fold ``i``):

    test  = block i
    dev   = block (i + 1) % k
    train = remaining k - 2 blocks

Invariants enforced by assertions:

* the union of all folds' ``test_idx`` is the full sentence index range,
  with no overlaps (every sentence is tested exactly once -- the
  jack-knife property);
* within each fold, ``train`` / ``dev`` / ``test`` are pairwise disjoint;
* the split is bit-for-bit reproducible for a fixed seed;
* in ``grouped`` mode, no source spans more than one fold's ``test_idx``.
